Agriculture has several other aspects like fishery, livestock and poultry. All these are also very important in that they have to do with the production of items which humans consume for survival. In many parts of the world today, farming has been regarded as the mainstay of the economy. Crops such cocoa, rubber and cotton have been produced in such commercial quantity that they are sold to other countries. Some countries have better comparative advantage in producing certain crops than other countries. In these other countries, there is the need to spend a lot of money on agriculture, particularly farming. Most farmers use outmoded tools. A lot of them have no place to store their crops, most of which are always destroyed by insects and pests before harvest time. All these have adverse effects on productivity. The government can do a lot to help farmers. Farmers co-operative societies can be encouraged and loans can be made available to farmers through Government institutions like banks and finance corporations. Farmers can be taught how to build good storage structures for their produce All these can help to improve the conditions of farming in these countries.",
