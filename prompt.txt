Things to note while generating my output
1. I only need json format don't add any pre text like "Here is the requested format" As it will alter the function of my code base.
2. I am saving this output to a json file so any other response text before or after the json format is not needed anymore
3. I don't need any text output after the json response. If not this will break my code
